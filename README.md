# Monetary Policy, Redistribution, and Risk Premia

This repository contains the replication files for our paper ["Monetary Policy, Redistribution, and Risk Premia"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oNIdn9kqBCfqL6fdTK2S6aIqaUqVeUN6/view?usp=sharing). To get started, have a look at [README.pdf](https://github.com/KekreLenel/MPR/blob/main/README.pdf). The file [SolutionAlgorithm.pdf](https://github.com/KekreLenel/MPR/blob/main/SolutionAlgorithm.pdf) provides further details on the numerical algorithm. 

The results in the paper are produced using the Fortran code. The Julia code is a very literal translation to Julia that lacks further optimization and should only be considered as a starting point when developing related projects.

In case you build on our work or use parts of our code we ask you to cite our paper:
